#### BLACKLIST README ####
Add domains or paths to be blacklisted (damn DMCA).
You can input any part of URL as wildcard, so domain, path, query, also protocol or any combination.
example.com - this will block ALL requests for domain example.com
/harry-potter - this will block for example http://example.com/harry-potter-torrent
example.com/torrent - this will block all paths starting with torrent at domain example.com
.eu - this will block all TLD .eu domains AND sub-domains where domain starts by eu, for example www.europ.com (TODO fix)
IMPORTANT: I recommend leaving default blacklist or you will get bad looking DMCAs after few day/weeks.
